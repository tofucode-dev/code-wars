Perfet solution:

```
export const rowSumOddNumbers = (n: number) => n ** 3;
```

The mathematical solution comes from two key insights:

The first number in each row follows a pattern:

- Row 1: 1 = 1
- Row 2: 3 = 1 + 2
- Row 3: 7 = 1 + 2 + 4
- Row 4: 13 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 6
- Row 5: 21 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 8

Each row's sum can be calculated using:

```
row_sum = n * (first_number_in_row + last_number_in_row) / 2
```

Here's the most elegant solution:

```
export const rowSumOddNumbers = (n: number) => n ** 3;
```

Why is this the perfect solution?
The sum of any row n in this triangle is always equal to n³ (n cubed). This is a mathematical property that can be proven:

- The first number in row n is: n² - n + 1
- Each row contains n consecutive odd numbers
- The last number in row n is: n² + n - 1
- Using the arithmetic sequence sum formula: n (first + last) / 2
- This simplifies to n³
